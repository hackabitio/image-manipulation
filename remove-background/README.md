# Remove object background

Install dependencies:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Remove background with [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) which is simple to use and quite powerfull and pillow:
`python remove-pil.py`

Alternatively, using opencv. This method doesn't always work as intended though.
`python remove-cv.py`
